                Fantasy Olympics is a game of chance created to simulate the 
                selection of a fantasy sports league for the 2020 Tokyo 
                Summer Olympics. Upon starting the game, each player will 
                draft a league of 8 teams that will score them points. Once 
                the teams are selected, each event is simulated and the 
                medalists are determined. However, before each event is 
                determined, each player has the opportunity to bet on which
                team will win to gain more points.
            </p>
